        "The purpose of the Astro Development Tool-Kit is to provide an open source full-package image processing library for **Satellite Surveillence**. Currently no python library exists for the purpose of SSA photometry and processing, as most of the libraries within the Astropy catalog are tailored towards **Stellar Astronomy.**\n",

        "Additional python libraries can be found at:\n",
        "https://www.astropy.org\n",

        "In order to run the program the following external items are required:\n",

        "1.   Star Catalog* *(UCAC4 recommended)*\n",
        "2.   Reference Star File *(downloaded from github)*\n",
