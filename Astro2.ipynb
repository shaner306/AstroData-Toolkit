        "### Preface\n",
        "The purpose of the Astro Development Tool-Kit is to provide an open source full-package image processing library for **Satellite Surveillence**. Currently no python library exists for the purpose of SSA photometry and processing, as most of the libraries within the Astropy catalog are tailored towards **Stellar Astronomy.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Additional python libraries can be found at:\n",
        "https://www.astropy.org\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to run the program the following external items are required:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Star Catalog* *(UCAC4 recommended)*\n",
        "2.   Reference Star File *(downloaded from github)*\n",
        "3.   [Visual Pinpoint V7.0 and 64bit addon](https://forums.dc3.com/showthread.php?13785-PinPoint-7-0-Released)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**A brief examination of the different star catalogs is provided at the end of this notebook.*\n",
        "\n",
        "The program contains several independant modules that can either be run seperately or as a series, depending on the files input into the processor, and the needs of the researcher.\n",
        "\n",
        "The processor can read **.fit, .fits, and .FIT** files, and each image file should have a valid header complying with the [NASA Standards.](https://https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_primer.html)\n",
        "\n",
        "Prior to input ensure the following KEYWORDS are present in the .fits files. These KEYWORDS should be automatically set on the CCD or sensor software prior to image capture. \n",
        "\n",
        "The processor is available in both a standalone GUI and Python library format. \n",
        "\n",
        "The following modules are available within this library:\n",
        "1. [Image Reduction](#GUI)\n",

        "The following outline below is a simplified workflow detailing the steps and procedures taken by the processor and a example researcher throughout the entire process, from image capture to data output. \n",
        "\n",
        "Step 1. Image Capture\n",
        "- Images are captured via CCD or CMOS censor and exported with the appropriate header KEYWORDS into a series of .fits file.\n",
        "- If necessary, images are captured using various filters, and calibration frames for Bias, Darks, and Flats are captured prior to star tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 2. Image Reduction\n",
        "- Bias, Dark, and Flat frames for the specified sensor are stacked and combined to form their respective \"Master\" files. \n",
        "- Using the Image Reduction method, the three Master Frames are subtracted from the light images, eliminating most of the distortion and biases due to the sensor. \n",
        "\n",
        "Step 3. *(If TRM)* Streak Detection and Classification\n",
        "- TBA\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 4. *(if SSM)* Pinpoint Solve\n",
        "- The subtracted light images are run through Pinpoint software, using either the default values defined within the processor, or adjusted values tailored to the specific images and sensor. \n",
        "- Pinpoint's internal detection algorithm detects the # of objects in the image, as well as the # of catalog objects at the estimated region. **(Region is determined by the estimated RA and DEC provided by the initial fits header)**\n",
        "- Pinpoint attempts to match the pixel location, and raw flux of the detected objects to those of the catalog objects.\n",
        "- If a match is detected, Pinpoint adjusts the header values for RA and DEC to their precise locations. (Also known as Astrometry)\n",
